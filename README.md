# Hello, I'm Joshua 👋

I’m a **bad singer**, a **failed comedian**, and a **former Scratch teacher** . While I never made it to the comedy stage or found my voice as a singer, I did pick up a few skills along the way. These days, I’m all about **leading**, **collaborating**, and building strong **communities**. I can’t promise you’ll laugh at my jokes, but I *can* promise you I’ll get the job done.

---

- **Programming**: Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Web Development**: Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, React
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub, GitLab, Docker, CI/CD
- **Cloud**: AWS, Cloud Computing
- **Design**: Miro, Figma

## Fun Fact
I used to have a lot of fun… then I got older and realized *debugging code* is its own kind of fun. And **MrBakes**? doesn’t involve baking anything. If I’m in the kitchen, something’s definitely going wrong. 🎤🍰

## What I Do
I’m good at **leading** teams, getting things done, and making sure the process stays smooth—even if the path is a little bumpy. I believe in collaboration, and I’m always looking to create something better with a group of like-minded people. If I can make it work and avoid total chaos, we’re good!
